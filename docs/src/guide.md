## Installation
---

To install `RunStatistics.jl`, start Julia and run

```Julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> pkg"add RunStatistics"
```

To use `RunStatistics.jl` after installation, run

```Julia
julia> using RunStatistics
```
to gain access to the functions provided in the package.


## Using RunStatistics.jl
---

To use the `RunStatistics.jl` to calculate and interpret the Squares statistic for the data you observed, first make sure the following assumptions are valid:

- All observations ``\{X_i\}`` are independent.
- Each observation is normally distributed, ``X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i)``
- Mean ``\mu_i`` and variance ``\sigma^2_i`` are known.

If your model satisfies these conditions, bring it into the form of an array `X` of length `N`, so that `X[i]` contains the i-th observation.

To obtain the p-value for the value of the Squares statistic observed in your data, do this:

### Calculate ``T_{obs}``

To obtain the value of the Squares statistic ``T`` observed in the data, ``T_{obs}``, do:

```Julia
julia> t_obs(X, μ, σ2)
```

where ``\mu`` and ``\sigma 2`` are the mean and variance of the normal distribution the data follows.

`t_obs()` returns a tuple containing the desired value ``T_{obs}`` as well as one or more arrays containing the indices ``i`` of the observations ``\{X_i\}`` in the run(s) that produce ``T_{obs}``. (It is generally possible that more than one run produces the same value for ``T``.)

In case the observations ``\{X_i\}`` have individual expectations and variances, do:

```Julia
julia> t_obs(X, μ, σ2)
```

But with ``\mu`` and ``\sigma 2`` being *Arrays* where ``\mu[i]`` and ``\sigma 2[i]`` are the mean and variance of the i-th element of `X`.

### Calculate the p-value and evaluate the cumulative distribution function of ``T``

To obtain the exact p-value given the value of ``T_{obs}`` for ``N \lesssim 100`` data points, or evaluate the cumulative distribution function of ``T`` do:

```Julia
julia> squares_pvalue(T_obs, N)
```
or
<!-- the p value is defined as 1 - cdf. I don't know how you define the cdf in your code but it should follow that convention! -->
```Julia
julia> squares_cdf(T_obs, N)
```

In case the number ``L`` of observations in the data set exceeds ``L \gtrsim 100``, do:

```Julia
julia> squares_pvalue_approx(T_obs, L)
```
or
```Julia
julia> squares_cdf_approx(T_obs, L)
```
to obtain the approximation for the p-value or the cumulative.

It is possible to control the approximation more accurately with additional methods and optional input arguments. See [Approximation for large numbers of data](@ref) below for more information.
## Details of computation
---

In the following some more in-depth information on the calculations performed with `RunStatistics.jl` is given.

Following the derivation of the p-value for ``T`` in [^1], the quantity that is being computed here is

```math
P(T < T_{obs} | N)
```

This is the value of the [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) of ``T`` at the value ``T_{obs}`` observed in a sequence of ``N`` datapoints.

The p-value then is obtained as ``p = 1- P(T < T_{obs} | N)``.

The central calculation in this package implements Equation (16) from [^1]:

```math
P(T < T_{obs} | N) = \sum_{r = 1}^{N}\sum_{M = 1}^{M_{max}}\sum_{\pi} X(T_{obs}, N)
```

The full derivation of ``P(T < T_{obs} | N)`` and an explanation for the parameters in the above equation can be found in section 2 of [^1].

For this manual, suffice it to say that the only input parameters that need to be known are ``T_{obs}`` and ``N``, the total number of observed data points. The other parameters are then calculated from them.

The computationally expensive operation is the sum over ``\pi``. Here ``\pi`` denotes the set of inequivalent sequences of success and failure runs in the observed sequence of data. Given a total number ``r`` of successes in a sequence of ``N`` observations with ``M`` success runs, ``\pi`` is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of [*integer partitions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) of ``r`` into ``M`` summands [^2].

When the cumulative of ``T`` is evaluated at ``T_{obs}`` for ``N`` data points, the relevant partitions need to be calculated.

### Partitions
---

In this package, a partition of an integer ``n`` into ``k`` parts is represented with a `Partition()` object. It holds the fields:

    n::Int
    k::Int
    h::Int          Number of *distinct* parts
    c::Vector{Int}  Multiplicities of parts
    y::Vector{Int}  parts

With these parameters, a partition can be represented in the *multiplicity representation*:
```math
\begin{align}
n = \sum_{i = 2}^{h + 1} c_i \cdot y_i
\end{align}
```
It is important to note the indexing of the arrays holding the parts and their multiplicities. Due to the implementation of the algorithm used to generate partitions, the first elements of `c` and `y` hold a buffer value, and the arrays always have a length of `1 + the maximum possible number of parts`.

So when reading a partition, always use the above equation: ignore the first element of `c` and `y` and do not read beyond `c[h + 1]` and `y[h + 1]`.

To save memory during the evaluation of the cumulative, a partition object is initiated and updated in place during the summation over the set of possible partitions.

The function that updates a partition is `next_partition!()`. It implements a modified version of *Algorithm Z* from

*A. Zoghbi: Algorithms for generating integer partitions, Ottawa (1993)*.
### Approximation for large numbers of data
---
As discussed in the [Introduction](@ref) the method for approximating the value of the cumulative for large numbers ``L`` of observations involves splitting L into ``n`` sequences containing ``N`` observations.

The original paper's[^2] authors have tested different combinations of ``n`` and ``N`` and found that they agree up to nine significant digits.

The default values in this package are ``N = 80`` and ``n = L / N``, but user defined choices can also be used by calling:

```Julia
julia> squares_pvalue_approx(T_obs, N, n)
```
or
```Julia
julia> squares_cdf_approx(T_obs, N, n)
```

``n`` does not need to be an integer.

For these approximations, this package implements equation (17) from [^2]:

```math
\begin{align}
F(T_{obs} | nN) = \frac{F(T_{obs} | N)^n}{(1 + \Delta(T_{obs}))^{n-1}} \quad \text{for} \quad n\ge 2
\end{align}
```

``F(T_{obs} | L) \equiv P(T < T_{obs} | L)`` denotes the value of the cumulative of ``T`` for a (long) sequence of ``L`` observations. 

So, if a total number of ``L`` data points have been observed, choose ``n`` and ``N`` so that ``n \cdot N = L``. The exact value of ``F(T_{obs} | N) \equiv P(T < T_{obs} | N)`` is then calculated and further processed in accordance with the above equation.

The approximate p-value for the data set then is:

```math
\begin{align}
p = 1 - F(T_{obs} | nN)
\end{align}
```

``\Delta(T_{obs})`` is a correction term (see equation (13) in [^2]) whose computation involves a 1D numerical integration. This is performed with the `quadgk()` function from the [`QuadGK.jl`](https://juliapackages.com/p/quadgk) package.


### Accuracy
---

The precision of the Approximation of ``F(T | nN)`` can be evaluated as:

```math
\begin{align}
dF(T | nN) \leq n ~ dF(T | N) \oplus (1 - n) ~ d\Delta(T)
\end{align}
```
where ``\oplus`` indicates addition in quadrature (See section C of [^2]).

To reach a given precision ``\epsilon`` on ``p`` or ``F(T | nN)``, it is required that ``F(T | N)`` and ``\Delta(T)`` are evaluated to an absolute precision ``\epsilon/n``. The calculation of ``F(T | N)`` is performed to double floating point precision, so up to an absolute precision of at least ``10^{-15}``, which limits the possible precision of ``p`` and ``F(T | nN)``.


As an example, for ``L = 10^6``, ``N = 100``, and ``\epsilon = 10^{−5}``, we would need an absolute precision on ``F(T | N)`` and ``\Delta(T)`` at the ``10^{−9}`` level.

To assure this level is reached, the additional argument `epsp` in the `squares_pvalue_approx()` and `squares_cdf_approx()` functions can be specified:

```Julia
julia> squares_pvalue_approx(T_obs, L, epsp)
```
or
```Julia
julia> squares_cdf_approx(T_obs, L, epsp)
```

This call yields a conservative approximation by setting the absolute error tolerance of the 1D integration that yields ``\Delta(T)`` to be one order of magnitude greater than necessary for the desired accuracy `epsp` of ``p`` or the cumulative. If not specified, the default value of the `quadgk()` function used for the integration is used. See [documentation](https://juliamath.github.io/QuadGK.jl/stable/).

---

**Rule of thumb**: to obtain a quick approximation of ``p`` or ``F(T | nN)``, call:

```Julia
julia> squares_pvalue_approx(T_obs, L)
```
or
```Julia
julia> squares_cdf_approx(T_obs, L)
```
And if a certain accuracy `epsp` ``\geq n \cdot 10^{-14}`` is desired, call:

```Julia
julia> squares_pvalue_approx(T_obs, L, epsp)
```
or
```Julia
julia> squares_cdf_approx(T_obs, L, epsp)
```
